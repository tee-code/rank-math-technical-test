It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.\n\nKayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \"hunter's boat\" was for hunting and fishing. The kayak's stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey. By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport. In 1931, a man named Adolf Anderle became the first person to kayak down the Salzachofen Gorge, this is where the birthplace of modern-day white-water kayaking is believed to have begun. Kayak races were introduced in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. \n\nIn the 1950s fiberglass kayaks were developed and commonly used, until 1980s when polyethylene plastic kayaks came about. Kayaking progressed as a fringe sport in the U.S. until the 1970s, when it became a mainstream popular sport. Now, more than 10 white water kayaking events are featured in the Olympics.While kayaking represents a key international watersport, few academic studies have been conducted on the role kayaking plays in the lives and activities of the public .","parent":0,"count":8,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"70"}},{"term_id":27,"name":"River Rafting","slug":"river-rafting","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":27,"taxonomy":"activities","description":"An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience.

Lewis Carroll's fantasy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865 in England, was a landmark in the genre; regarded as the first \"English masterpiece written for children\", its publication opened the \"First Golden Age\" of children's literature.\n\nThe latter half of the 19th century saw the introduction of compulsory state schooling of children across Europe, which decisively removed children from the workplace into schools. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the concept of childhood as a time of fun of happiness. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys.

Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.\n\nThe verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, \"one who offers himself for military service,\" from the Middle French voluntaire. In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.

Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday.

This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning.

Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; the later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British crown rule.

Road bikes also use narrow, high-pressure tires to decrease rolling resistance, and tend to be somewhat lighter than other types of bicycle. The drop handlebars are often positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic position. In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars. Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s. The light weight and aerodynamics of a road bike allows this type of bicycle to be the second most efficient self-powered means of transportation, behind only recumbent bicycles due to the latter's higher aerodynamic efficiency.","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"186"}}],"trip_types":[{"term_id":7,"name":"Budget travel","slug":"budget-travel","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":7,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.\n\nKayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \"hunter's boat\" was for hunting and fishing. The kayak's stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey. By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport. In 1931, a man named Adolf Anderle became the first person to kayak down the Salzachofen Gorge, this is where the birthplace of modern-day white-water kayaking is believed to have begun. Kayak races were introduced in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. \n\nIn the 1950s fiberglass kayaks were developed and commonly used, until 1980s when polyethylene plastic kayaks came about. Kayaking progressed as a fringe sport in the U.S. until the 1970s, when it became a mainstream popular sport. Now, more than 10 white water kayaking events are featured in the Olympics.While kayaking represents a key international watersport, few academic studies have been conducted on the role kayaking plays in the lives and activities of the public .","parent":0,"count":8,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"70"}},{"term_id":27,"name":"River Rafting","slug":"river-rafting","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":27,"taxonomy":"activities","description":"An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience.

In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars. Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s.

Volunteering is also renowned for skill development and is often intended to promote goodness or to improve human quality of life. Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served. It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.\n\nThe verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, \"one who offers himself for military service,\" from the Middle French voluntaire. In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen. Barton founded the American Red Cross in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the Johnstown Flood in 1889.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"200"}},{"term_id":34,"name":"Weekend Trips","slug":"weekend-trips","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":34,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"The workweek and weekend are those complementary parts of the week devoted to labour and rest, respectively.

Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning.

It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.\n\nKayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \"hunter's boat\" was for hunting and fishing. The kayak's stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey. By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport. In 1931, a man named Adolf Anderle became the first person to kayak down the Salzachofen Gorge, this is where the birthplace of modern-day white-water kayaking is believed to have begun. Kayak races were introduced in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. \n\nIn the 1950s fiberglass kayaks were developed and commonly used, until 1980s when polyethylene plastic kayaks came about. Kayaking progressed as a fringe sport in the U.S. until the 1970s, when it became a mainstream popular sport. Now, more than 10 white water kayaking events are featured in the Olympics.While kayaking represents a key international watersport, few academic studies have been conducted on the role kayaking plays in the lives and activities of the public .","parent":0,"count":8,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"70"}},{"term_id":27,"name":"River Rafting","slug":"river-rafting","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":27,"taxonomy":"activities","description":"An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience.

Road bikes also use narrow, high-pressure tires to decrease rolling resistance, and tend to be somewhat lighter than other types of bicycle. The drop handlebars are often positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic position. In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars. Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s. The light weight and aerodynamics of a road bike allows this type of bicycle to be the second most efficient self-powered means of transportation, behind only recumbent bicycles due to the latter's higher aerodynamic efficiency.","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"186"}}],"trip_types":[{"term_id":7,"name":"Budget travel","slug":"budget-travel","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":7,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

Safari entered the English language at the end of the 1850s thanks to Richard Francis Burton, the famous explorer.\nThe Regimental March of the King's African Rifles was 'Funga Safari', literally 'tie up the March', or, in other words, pack up equipment ready to march.\n\nIn 1836 William Cornwallis Harris led an expedition purely to observe and record wildlife and landscapes by the expedition's members. Harris established the safari style of journey, starting with a not too strenuous rising at first light, an energetic day walking, an afternoon rest then concluding with a formal dinner and telling stories in the evening over drinks and tobacco.","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"191"}},{"term_id":28,"name":"Road Cycling","slug":"road-cycling","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":28,"taxonomy":"activities","description":"Road cycling is the most widespread form of cycling. It includes recreational, racing, and utility cycling. Road cyclists are generally expected to obey the same rules and laws as other vehicle drivers or riders and may also be vehicular cyclists.\n\nDedicated road bicycles have drop handlebars and multiple gears, although there are single and fixed gear varieties. Road bikes also use narrow, high-pressure tires to decrease rolling resistance, and tend to be somewhat lighter than other types of bicycle. The drop handlebars are often positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic position. In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars. Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s. The light weight and aerodynamics of a road bike allows this type of bicycle to be the second most efficient self-powered means of transportation, behind only recumbent bicycles due to the latter's higher aerodynamic efficiency.","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"186"}}],"trip_types":[{"term_id":7,"name":"Budget travel","slug":"budget-travel","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":7,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served. It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.\n\nThe verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, \"one who offers himself for military service,\" from the Middle French voluntaire. In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen. Barton founded the American Red Cross in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the Johnstown Flood in 1889.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"200"}},{"term_id":34,"name":"Weekend Trips","slug":"weekend-trips","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":34,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"The workweek and weekend are those complementary parts of the week devoted to labour and rest, respectively.

In most of the Western world, it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning.

Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served. It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.\n\nThe verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, \"one who offers himself for military service,\" from the Middle French voluntaire. In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.

It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.\n\nKayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \"hunter's boat\" was for hunting and fishing. The kayak's stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey. By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport. In 1931, a man named Adolf Anderle became the first person to kayak down the Salzachofen Gorge, this is where the birthplace of modern-day white-water kayaking is believed to have begun. Kayak races were introduced in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. \n\nIn the 1950s fiberglass kayaks were developed and commonly used, until 1980s when polyethylene plastic kayaks came about. Kayaking progressed as a fringe sport in the U.S. until the 1970s, when it became a mainstream popular sport. Now, more than 10 white water kayaking events are featured in the Olympics.While kayaking represents a key international watersport, few academic studies have been conducted on the role kayaking plays in the lives and activities of the public .","parent":0,"count":8,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"70"}},{"term_id":27,"name":"River Rafting","slug":"river-rafting","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":27,"taxonomy":"activities","description":"An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience.

Road bikes also use narrow, high-pressure tires to decrease rolling resistance, and tend to be somewhat lighter than other types of bicycle. The drop handlebars are often positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic position. In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars. Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s. The light weight and aerodynamics of a road bike allows this type of bicycle to be the second most efficient self-powered means of transportation, behind only recumbent bicycles due to the latter's higher aerodynamic efficiency.","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"186"}}],"trip_types":[{"term_id":7,"name":"Budget travel","slug":"budget-travel","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":7,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.\n\nKayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \"hunter's boat\" was for hunting and fishing. The kayak's stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey. By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport. In 1931, a man named Adolf Anderle became the first person to kayak down the Salzachofen Gorge, this is where the birthplace of modern-day white-water kayaking is believed to have begun.

The genre of children's literature took off, with a proliferation of humorous, child-oriented books attuned to the child's imagination. Lewis Carroll's fantasy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865 in England, was a landmark in the genre; regarded as the first \"English masterpiece written for children\", its publication opened the \"First Golden Age\" of children's literature.\n\nThe latter half of the 19th century saw the introduction of compulsory state schooling of children across Europe, which decisively removed children from the workplace into schools. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the concept of childhood as a time of fun of happiness. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys.

The American Kennel Club also offers a Companion dog title for judged dog obedience competitions.\n\nBreed groups argue that any dog in the working group type is inherently a \"working\" dog, while others argue that only a dog with an active occupation, either in a breed-related field (such as water trials for retrievers or herding trials for herding dogs) or in a breed-nonspecific field that requires training and discipline, such as being assistance dogs or participating in dog agility, can be considered a working dog.\n\nDogs that have been chosen for traits that make a convenient pet are generally smaller breeds, and the tradition of keeping pretty dogs for no purpose other than to be court decorations stems back thousands of years to Chinese nobility.

Volunteering is also renowned for skill development and is often intended to promote goodness or to improve human quality of life. Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served. It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.\n\nThe verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, \"one who offers himself for military service,\" from the Middle French voluntaire. In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen. Barton founded the American Red Cross in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the Johnstown Flood in 1889.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":"200"}},{"term_id":34,"name":"Weekend Trips","slug":"weekend-trips","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":34,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"The workweek and weekend are those complementary parts of the week devoted to labour and rest, respectively. The legal working week (British English), or workweek (American English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labour. In most of the Western world, it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in

For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-0e9f588a-de1e-4708-bc48-16bab48ff199\">Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for the world&nbsp;production of textiles&nbsp;and&nbsp;clothing&nbsp;are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.

These sectors are Textile Design and Production,&nbsp;Fashion Design&nbsp;and Manufacturing, Fashion Retailing, Marketing and Merchandising,&nbsp;Fashion Shows, and Media and Marketing.

This was capitalized on by people like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together. Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the Second World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots.

Road bikes also use narrow, high-pressure tires to decrease rolling resistance, and tend to be somewhat lighter than other types of bicycle. The drop handlebars are often positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic position. In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars. Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s.

A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well. Kayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \u201chunter\u2019s boat\u201d was for hunting and fishing. The kayak\u2019s stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey.

Many of the toy dog breeds are used only for the pleasure of their company, not as workers. Any dog can be a companion dog, and many working types such as retrievers are enjoyed primarily for their friendly nature as a family pet, as are mixed breed dogs. The American Kennel Club also offers a Companion dog title for judged dog obedience competitions.

Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.[1] The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often\u2026","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":3,"post_date":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","post_date_gmt":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","guid":"https:\/\/demosprint.top\/testproject21\/?p=1856","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_menu_item_type":"taxonomy","_menu_item_menu_item_parent":"0","_menu_item_object_id":"31","_menu_item_object":"destination","_menu_item_target":"","_menu_item_classes":[""],"_menu_item_xfn":"","_menu_item_url":""},"terms":{"category":[],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[{"term_id":35,"name":"Footer Menu","slug":"footer-menu","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":35,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}},{"type_title":"Navigation Menu Items","post_id":1857,"post_title":"","post_status":"publish","post_name":"1857","post_content":"The Maldives is a South Asian island country, located in the Indian Ocean, situated in the Arabian Sea.

It includes recreational, racing, and utility cycling. Road cyclists are generally expected to obey the same rules and laws as other vehicle drivers or riders and may also be vehicular cyclists. Dedicated road bicycles have drop handlebars and multiple gears, although there are single and fixed gear varieties. Road bikes also use narrow, high-pressure tires to decrease rolling resistance, and tend to be somewhat lighter than other types of bicycle. The drop handlebars are often positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic position. In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars. Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s. The light weight and aerodynamics of a road bike allows this type of bicycle to be the second most efficient self-powered means of transportation, behind only recumbent bicycles due to the latter\u2019s higher aerodynamic efficiency.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":1,"post_date":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","post_date_gmt":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","guid":"https:\/\/demosprint.top\/testproject21\/?p=1858","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_menu_item_type":"taxonomy","_menu_item_menu_item_parent":"0","_menu_item_object_id":"28","_menu_item_object":"activities","_menu_item_target":"","_menu_item_classes":[""],"_menu_item_xfn":"","_menu_item_url":""},"terms":{"category":[],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[{"term_id":36,"name":"Footer menu 2","slug":"footer-menu-2","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":36,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}},{"type_title":"Navigation Menu Items","post_id":1859,"post_title":"","post_status":"publish","post_name":"1859","post_content":"Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.

In the past, the trip was often a big-game hunt, but today, safari often refers to trips to observe and photograph wildlife\u2014or hiking and sightseeing, as well. The Swahili word safari means journey, originally from the Arabic meaning a journey; the verb for \u201cto travel\u201d in Swahili is kusafiri. These words are used for any type of journey, e.g. by bus from Nairobi to Mombasa or by ferry from Dar es Salaam to Unguja. Safari entered the English language at the end of the 1850s thanks to Richard Francis Burton, the famous explorer. The Regimental March of the King\u2019s African Rifles was \u2018Funga Safari\u2019, literally \u2018tie up the March\u2019, or, in other words, pack up equipment ready to march. In 1836 William Cornwallis Harris led an expedition purely to observe and record wildlife and landscapes by the expedition\u2019s members. Harris established the safari style of journey, starting with a not too strenuous rising at first light, an energetic day walking, an afternoon rest then concluding with a formal dinner and telling stories in the evening over drinks and tobacco.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":4,"post_date":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","post_date_gmt":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","guid":"https:\/\/demosprint.top\/testproject21\/?p=1912","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_menu_item_type":"taxonomy","_menu_item_menu_item_parent":"0","_menu_item_object_id":"16","_menu_item_object":"activities","_menu_item_target":"","_menu_item_classes":[""],"_menu_item_xfn":"","_menu_item_url":""},"terms":{"category":[],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[{"term_id":36,"name":"Footer menu 2","slug":"footer-menu-2","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":36,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}},{"type_title":"Navigation Menu Items","post_id":1913,"post_title":"","post_status":"publish","post_name":"1913","post_content":"An educational trail (or sometimes educational path), nature trail or nature walk is a specially developed hiking trail or footpath that runs through the countryside, along which there are marked stations or stops next to points of natural, technological or cultural interest. These may convey information about, for example, flora and fauna, soil science, geology, mining, ecology or cultural history. Longer trails, that link more widely spaced natural phenomena or structures together, may be referred to as themed trails or paths. In order to give a clearer explanation of the objects located at each station, display boards or other exhibits are usually erected, in keeping with the purpose of the trail. These may include: information boards, photographs and pictures, maps or plans, display cases and models, slides, sound or multimedia devices, facilities to enable experimentation and so on. The routes are regularly maintained. Educational trails with a strong thematic content may also be called \u201ctheme paths\u201d, \u201ctheme trails\u201d or \u201ctheme routes\u201d, or may be specially named after their subject matter, for example the Welsh Mountain Zoo Trail, Anglezarke Woodland Trail, Cheshire Lines Railway Path, Great Harwood Nature Trail, Irwell Sculpture Trail, Salthill Quarry Geology Trail and Wildlife Conservation Trail.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":1,"post_date":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","post_date_gmt":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","guid":"https:\/\/demosprint.top\/testproject21\/?p=1913","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_menu_item_type":"taxonomy","_menu_item_menu_item_parent":"0","_menu_item_object_id":"21","_menu_item_object":"trip_types","_menu_item_target":"","_menu_item_classes":[""],"_menu_item_xfn":"","_menu_item_url":""},"terms":{"category":[],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[{"term_id":37,"name":"Footer Menu 3","slug":"footer-menu-3","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":37,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}},{"type_title":"Navigation Menu Items","post_id":1914,"post_title":"","post_status":"publish","post_name":"1914","post_content":"The modern attitude to children emerged by the late 19th century; the Victorian middle and upper classes emphasized the role of the family and the sanctity of the child, \u2013 an attitude that has remained dominant in Western societies ever since. The genre of children\u2019s literature took off, with a proliferation of humorous, child-oriented books attuned to the child\u2019s imagination. Lewis Carroll\u2019s fantasy Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865 in England, was a landmark in the genre; regarded as the first \u201cEnglish masterpiece written for children\u201d, its publication opened the \u201cFirst Golden Age\u201d of children\u2019s literature. The latter half of the 19th century saw the introduction of compulsory state schooling of children across Europe, which decisively removed children from the workplace into schools. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the concept of childhood as a time of fun of happiness. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys. The Boy Scouts was founded by Sir Robert Baden-Powell in 1908,which provided young boys with outdoor activities aiming at developing character, citizenship, and personal fitness qualities.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":2,"post_date":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","post_date_gmt":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","guid":"https:\/\/demosprint.top\/testproject21\/?p=1914","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_menu_item_type":"taxonomy","_menu_item_menu_item_parent":"0","_menu_item_object_id":"8","_menu_item_object":"trip_types","_menu_item_target":"","_menu_item_classes":[""],"_menu_item_xfn":"","_menu_item_url":""},"terms":{"category":[],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[{"term_id":37,"name":"Footer Menu 3","slug":"footer-menu-3","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":37,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}},{"type_title":"Navigation Menu Items","post_id":1915,"post_title":"","post_status":"publish","post_name":"1915","post_content":"Companion dog usually describes a dog that does not work, providing only companionship as a pet, rather than usefulness by doing specific tasks. Many of the toy dog breeds are used only for the pleasure of their company, not as workers. Any dog can be a companion dog, and many working types such as retrievers are enjoyed primarily for their friendly nature as a family pet, as are mixed breed dogs. The American Kennel Club also offers a Companion dog title for judged dog obedience competitions. Breed groups argue that any dog in the working group type is inherently a \u201cworking\u201d dog, while others argue that only a dog with an active occupation, either in a breed-related field (such as water trials for retrievers or herding trials for herding dogs) or in a breed-nonspecific field that requires training and discipline, such as being assistance dogs or participating in dog agility, can be considered a working dog.

The concept of material culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social organization (including practices of political organization and social institutions), mythology, philosophy, literature (both written and oral), and science comprise the intangible cultural heritage of a society.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":4,"post_date":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","post_date_gmt":"2021-07-13 11:23:47","guid":"https:\/\/demosprint.top\/testproject21\/?p=1916","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_menu_item_type":"taxonomy","_menu_item_menu_item_parent":"0","_menu_item_object_id":"9","_menu_item_object":"trip_types","_menu_item_target":"","_menu_item_classes":[""],"_menu_item_xfn":"","_menu_item_url":""},"terms":{"category":[],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[{"term_id":37,"name":"Footer Menu 3","slug":"footer-menu-3","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":37,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}}]}
