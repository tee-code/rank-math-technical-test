Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against all with one winner.\n\nSports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2017-11-21 17:59:02","post_date_gmt":"2017-11-21 17:59:02","guid":"http:\/\/thebootstrapthemes.com\/demo\/magazine-newspaper\/?p=28","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"wpb_post_views_count":"11","_wp_old_slug":"rider","_jetpack_related_posts_cache":{"8f6677c9d6b0f903e98ad32ec61f8deb":{"expires":1519330392,"payload":[{"id":28}]}},"_edit_lock":"1640337603:1","_thumbnail_id":"91"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":3,"name":"Sports","slug":"sports","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":2,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":32,"post_title":"5 Header & 3 Slider Options","post_status":"publish","post_name":"the-copy-warned-the-little-blind-text","post_content":"Far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
