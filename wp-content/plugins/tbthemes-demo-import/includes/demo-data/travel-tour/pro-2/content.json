between 160\u2013230 km (100-145 mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended. This trek crosses two different river valleys and encircles the Annapurna massif. The path reaches its highest point at Thorung La pass (5416m\/17769 ft), touching the edge of the Tibetan plateau.\r\n\r\nPractically all trekkers hike the route anticlockwise, as this way the daily altitude gain is slower, and crossing the high Thorong La pass is easier and safer. The mountain scenery, seen at close quarters includes the Annapurna Massif (Annapurna I-IV), Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchhre, Manaslu, Gangapurna, Tilicho Peak, Pisang Peak, and Paungda Danda. Numerous other peaks of 6000-8000m in elevation rise from the Annapurna range. The trek begins at Besisahar or Bhulbhule in the Marshyangdi river valley and concludes in the Kali Gandaki Gorge.

Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the word &quot;travel&quot; is most likely lost to history. The term &quot;travel&quot; may originate from the Old French word travail, which means 'work'. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century.\r\n\r\nIt also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil). In English we still occasionally use the words &quot;travail&quot;, which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;travail&quot; both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale).\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;"},"itinerary":{"itinerary_title":{"1":"Kathmandu to Pokhara (By flight or Bus)","2":"Drive to Nayapul and trek to Ulleri","3":"Trek to Ghorepani","4":"Early trek to Poon Hill for Sunrise, Back to Ghorepani and Trek to Tadapani","5":"Tadapani to Chomrong","6":"Chomrong to Dobhan (Dovan)","7":"Dovan to Deurali"},"itinerary_content":{"1":"Arrive at Tribhuwan International Airport, Kathmandu, you are welcomed by the team and then you will be transferred to your hotel.

It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.\r\n\r\nKayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \"hunter's boat\" was for hunting and fishing. The kayak's stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey. By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport. In 1931, a man named Adolf Anderle became the first person to kayak down the Salzachofen Gorge, this is where the birthplace of modern-day white-water kayaking is believed to have begun. Kayak races were introduced in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s fiberglass kayaks were developed and commonly used, until 1980s when polyethylene plastic kayaks came about.

Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys. The Boy Scouts was founded by Sir Robert Baden-Powell in 1908,which provided young boys with outdoor activities aiming at developing character, citizenship, and personal fitness qualities.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"195\";i:1;s:3:\"195\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"195\";i:1;s:3:\"195\";}"]}},{"term_id":8,"name":"Cultural","slug":"cultural","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":8,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"Culture is the social behavior and norms found in human societies.

The American Kennel Club also offers a Companion dog title for judged dog obedience competitions.\n\nBreed groups argue that any dog in the working group type is inherently a \"working\" dog, while others argue that only a dog with an active occupation, either in a breed-related field (such as water trials for retrievers or herding trials for herding dogs) or in a breed-nonspecific field that requires training and discipline, such as being assistance dogs or participating in dog agility, can be considered a working dog.\n\nDogs that have been chosen for traits that make a convenient pet are generally smaller breeds, and the tradition of keeping pretty dogs for no purpose other than to be court decorations stems back thousands of years to Chinese nobility.

Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served. It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.\n\nThe verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, \"one who offers himself for military service,\" from the Middle French voluntaire. In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.

Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning.

In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars. Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s. The light weight and aerodynamics of a road bike allows this type of bicycle to be the second most efficient self-powered means of transportation, behind only recumbent bicycles due to the latter's higher aerodynamic efficiency.","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["186","186"],"wte-shortdesc-textarea":""}}],"trip_types":[{"term_id":6,"name":"Budget travel","slug":"budget-travel","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":6,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

Lewis Carroll's fantasy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865 in England, was a landmark in the genre; regarded as the first \"English masterpiece written for children\", its publication opened the \"First Golden Age\" of children's literature.\n\nThe latter half of the 19th century saw the introduction of compulsory state schooling of children across Europe, which decisively removed children from the workplace into schools. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the concept of childhood as a time of fun of happiness. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys.

Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.\n\nThe verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, \"one who offers himself for military service,\" from the Middle French voluntaire. In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.

Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday.

This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations.

According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;travail&quot; both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale).\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;"},"itinerary":{"itinerary_title":{"1":"Kathmandu to Pokhara (By flight or Bus)","2":"Drive to Nayapul and trek to Ulleri","3":"Trek to Ghorepani","4":"Early trek to Poon Hill for Sunrise, Back to Ghorepani and Trek to Tadapani","5":"Tadapani to Chomrong","6":"Chomrong to Dobhan (Dovan)","7":"Dovan to Deurali"},"itinerary_content":{"1":"Arrive at Tribhuwan International Airport, Kathmandu, you are welcomed by the team and then you will be transferred to your hotel.

Safari entered the English language at the end of the 1850s thanks to Richard Francis Burton, the famous explorer.\r\nThe Regimental March of the King's African Rifles was 'Funga Safari', literally 'tie up the March', or, in other words, pack up equipment ready to march.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 William Cornwallis Harris led an expedition purely to observe and record wildlife and landscapes by the expedition's members. Harris established the safari style of journey, starting with a not too strenuous rising at first light, an energetic day walking, an afternoon rest then concluding with a formal dinner and telling stories in the evening over drinks and tobacco.","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["191","191"],"wte-shortdesc-textarea":""}}],"trip_types":[{"term_id":6,"name":"Budget travel","slug":"budget-travel","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":6,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.\n\nThe verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, \"one who offers himself for military service,\" from the Middle French voluntaire. In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.

This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations.

Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}"]}}]}},{"type_title":"Trips","post_id":255,"post_title":"Chulu Peak Climbing","post_status":"publish","post_name":"chulu-peak-climbing","post_content":"The Annapurna Circuit is a trek within the Annapurna mountain range of central Nepal.The total length of the route varies between 160\u2013230 km (100-145 mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended.

According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;travail&quot; both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale).\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;"},"itinerary":{"itinerary_title":{"1":"Kathmandu to Pokhara (By flight or Bus)","2":"Drive to Nayapul and trek to Ulleri","3":"Trek to Ghorepani","4":"Early trek to Poon Hill for Sunrise, Back to Ghorepani and Trek to Tadapani","5":"Tadapani to Chomrong","6":"Chomrong to Dobhan (Dovan)","7":"Dovan to Deurali"},"itinerary_content":{"1":"Arrive at Tribhuwan International Airport, Kathmandu, you are welcomed by the team and then you will be transferred to your hotel.

The bulk of western and central Tibet  was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.[1] The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo. Most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"174\";i:1;s:3:\"174\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"174\";i:1;s:3:\"174\";}"]}},{"term_id":31,"name":"Venice","slug":"venice","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":31,"taxonomy":"destination","description":"Venice  is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region.

In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s.

People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.

It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.\r\n\r\nKayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \"hunter's boat\" was for hunting and fishing. The kayak's stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey. By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport. In 1931, a man named Adolf Anderle became the first person to kayak down the Salzachofen Gorge, this is where the birthplace of modern-day white-water kayaking is believed to have begun. Kayak races were introduced in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s fiberglass kayaks were developed and commonly used, until 1980s when polyethylene plastic kayaks came about. Kayaking progressed as a fringe sport in the U.S. until the 1970s, when it became a mainstream popular sport.

The legal working week (British English), or workweek (American English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labour. In most of the Western world, it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}"]}}]}},{"type_title":"Trips","post_id":257,"post_title":"Upper Mustang Trek","post_status":"publish","post_name":"upper-mustang-trek-2","post_content":"The Annapurna Circuit is a trek within the Annapurna mountain range of central Nepal.The total length of the route varies between 160\u2013230 km (100-145 mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended.

According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;travail&quot; both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale).\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;"},"itinerary":{"itinerary_title":{"1":"Kathmandu to Pokhara (By flight or Bus)","2":"Drive to Nayapul and trek to Ulleri","3":"Trek to Ghorepani","4":"Early trek to Poon Hill for Sunrise, Back to Ghorepani and Trek to Tadapani","5":"Tadapani to Chomrong","6":"Chomrong to Dobhan (Dovan)","7":"Dovan to Deurali"},"itinerary_content":{"1":"Arrive at Tribhuwan International Airport, Kathmandu, you are welcomed by the team and then you will be transferred to your hotel.

Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 4,900 metres (16,000 ft).[citation needed] The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet  was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.[1] The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo. Most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai.

The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen. Barton founded the American Red Cross in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the Johnstown Flood in 1889.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"200\";i:1;s:3:\"200\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"200\";i:1;s:3:\"200\";}"]}},{"term_id":33,"name":"Weekend Trips","slug":"weekend-trips","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":33,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"The workweek and weekend are those complementary parts of the week devoted to labour and rest, respectively. The legal working week (British English), or workweek (American English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labour. In most of the Western world, it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}"]}}]}},{"type_title":"Trips","post_id":259,"post_title":"Lake Kayaking","post_status":"publish","post_name":"lake-kayaking","post_content":"The Annapurna Circuit is a trek within the Annapurna mountain range of central Nepal.The total length of the route varies between 160\u2013230 km (100-145 mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended.

According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;travail&quot; both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale).\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;"},"itinerary":{"itinerary_title":{"1":"Kathmandu to Pokhara (By flight or Bus)","2":"Drive to Nayapul and trek to Ulleri","3":"Trek to Ghorepani","4":"Early trek to Poon Hill for Sunrise, Back to Ghorepani and Trek to Tadapani","5":"Tadapani to Chomrong","6":"Chomrong to Dobhan (Dovan)","7":"Dovan to Deurali"},"itinerary_content":{"1":"Arrive at Tribhuwan International Airport, Kathmandu, you are welcomed by the team and then you will be transferred to your hotel.

Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 4,900 metres (16,000 ft).[citation needed] The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet  was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.[1] The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo. Most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai.

It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.\r\n\r\nKayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \"hunter's boat\" was for hunting and fishing. The kayak's stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey. By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport. In 1931, a man named Adolf Anderle became the first person to kayak down the Salzachofen Gorge, this is where the birthplace of modern-day white-water kayaking is believed to have begun. Kayak races were introduced in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s fiberglass kayaks were developed and commonly used, until 1980s when polyethylene plastic kayaks came about. Kayaking progressed as a fringe sport in the U.S. until the 1970s, when it became a mainstream popular sport. Now, more than 10 white water kayaking events are featured in the Olympics.While kayaking represents a key international watersport, few academic studies have been conducted on the role kayaking plays in the lives and activities of the public .","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["161","161"],"wte-shortdesc-textarea":""}},{"term_id":26,"name":"River Rafting","slug":"river-rafting","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":26,"taxonomy":"activities","description":"An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience.

Lewis Carroll's fantasy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865 in England, was a landmark in the genre; regarded as the first \"English masterpiece written for children\", its publication opened the \"First Golden Age\" of children's literature.\n\nThe latter half of the 19th century saw the introduction of compulsory state schooling of children across Europe, which decisively removed children from the workplace into schools. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the concept of childhood as a time of fun of happiness. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys.

In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s.

Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.\r\n\r\nKayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \"hunter's boat\" was for hunting and fishing. The kayak's stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey. By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport.

It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, \"one who offers himself for military service,\" from the Middle French voluntaire. In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen. Barton founded the American Red Cross in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the Johnstown Flood in 1889.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"200\";i:1;s:3:\"200\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"200\";i:1;s:3:\"200\";}"]}},{"term_id":33,"name":"Weekend Trips","slug":"weekend-trips","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":33,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"The workweek and weekend are those complementary parts of the week devoted to labour and rest, respectively. The legal working week (British English), or workweek (American English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labour. In most of the Western world, it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}"]}}]}},{"type_title":"Trips","post_id":261,"post_title":"Trishuli River Rafting","post_status":"publish","post_name":"trishuli-river-rafting","post_content":"The Annapurna Circuit is a trek within the Annapurna mountain range of central Nepal.The total length of the route varies between 160\u2013230 km (100-145 mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended.

According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;travail&quot; both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale).\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;"},"itinerary":{"itinerary_title":{"1":"Kathmandu to Pokhara (By flight or Bus)","2":"Drive to Nayapul and trek to Ulleri","3":"Trek to Ghorepani","4":"Early trek to Poon Hill for Sunrise, Back to Ghorepani and Trek to Tadapani","5":"Tadapani to Chomrong","6":"Chomrong to Dobhan (Dovan)","7":"Dovan to Deurali"},"itinerary_content":{"1":"Arrive at Tribhuwan International Airport, Kathmandu, you are welcomed by the team and then you will be transferred to your hotel.

Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 4,900 metres (16,000 ft).[citation needed] The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet  was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.[1] The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo. Most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"174\";i:1;s:3:\"174\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"174\";i:1;s:3:\"174\";}"]}},{"term_id":31,"name":"Venice","slug":"venice","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":31,"taxonomy":"destination","description":"Venice  is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region.

It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.\r\n\r\nKayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \"hunter's boat\" was for hunting and fishing. The kayak's stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey. By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport. In 1931, a man named Adolf Anderle became the first person to kayak down the Salzachofen Gorge, this is where the birthplace of modern-day white-water kayaking is believed to have begun. Kayak races were introduced in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s fiberglass kayaks were developed and commonly used, until 1980s when polyethylene plastic kayaks came about. Kayaking progressed as a fringe sport in the U.S. until the 1970s, when it became a mainstream popular sport. Now, more than 10 white water kayaking events are featured in the Olympics.While kayaking represents a key international watersport, few academic studies have been conducted on the role kayaking plays in the lives and activities of the public .","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["161","161"],"wte-shortdesc-textarea":""}},{"term_id":26,"name":"River Rafting","slug":"river-rafting","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":26,"taxonomy":"activities","description":"An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience.

Road bikes also use narrow, high-pressure tires to decrease rolling resistance, and tend to be somewhat lighter than other types of bicycle. The drop handlebars are often positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic position. In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars. Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s.

People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen. Barton founded the American Red Cross in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the Johnstown Flood in 1889.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"200\";i:1;s:3:\"200\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"200\";i:1;s:3:\"200\";}"]}},{"term_id":33,"name":"Weekend Trips","slug":"weekend-trips","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":33,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"The workweek and weekend are those complementary parts of the week devoted to labour and rest, respectively. The legal working week (British English), or workweek (American English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labour. In most of the Western world, it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}"]}}]}},{"type_title":"Trips","post_id":263,"post_title":"Pokahara, Nepal","post_status":"publish","post_name":"pokahara","post_content":"The Annapurna Circuit is a trek within the Annapurna mountain range of central Nepal.The total length of the route varies between 160\u2013230 km (100-145 mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended.

According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;travail&quot; both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale).\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;"},"itinerary":{"itinerary_title":{"1":"Kathmandu to Pokhara (By flight or Bus)","2":"Drive to Nayapul and trek to Ulleri","3":"Trek to Ghorepani","4":"Early trek to Poon Hill for Sunrise, Back to Ghorepani and Trek to Tadapani","5":"Tadapani to Chomrong","6":"Chomrong to Dobhan (Dovan)","7":"Dovan to Deurali"},"itinerary_content":{"1":"Arrive at Tribhuwan International Airport, Kathmandu, you are welcomed by the team and then you will be transferred to your hotel.

Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 4,900 metres (16,000 ft).[citation needed] The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet  was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.[1] The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo. Most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai.

The legal working week (British English), or workweek (American English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labour. In most of the Western world, it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}"]}}]}},{"type_title":"Trips","post_id":265,"post_title":"Colosseum, Rome, Italy","post_status":"publish","post_name":"colosseum","post_content":"The Annapurna Circuit is a trek within the Annapurna mountain range of central Nepal.The total length of the route varies between 160\u2013230 km (100-145 mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended.

According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;travail&quot; both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale).\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;"},"itinerary":{"itinerary_title":{"1":"Kathmandu to Pokhara (By flight or Bus)","2":"Drive to Nayapul and trek to Ulleri","3":"Trek to Ghorepani","4":"Early trek to Poon Hill for Sunrise, Back to Ghorepani and Trek to Tadapani","5":"Tadapani to Chomrong","6":"Chomrong to Dobhan (Dovan)","7":"Dovan to Deurali"},"itinerary_content":{"1":"Arrive at Tribhuwan International Airport, Kathmandu, you are welcomed by the team and then you will be transferred to your hotel.

Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 4,900 metres (16,000 ft).[citation needed] The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet  was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.[1] The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo. Most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"174\";i:1;s:3:\"174\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"174\";i:1;s:3:\"174\";}"]}},{"term_id":31,"name":"Venice","slug":"venice","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":31,"taxonomy":"destination","description":"Venice  is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region.

Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.\n\nThe verb was first recorded in 1755.

In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.

Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday.

This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations.

In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; the later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"172\";i:1;s:3:\"172\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"172\";i:1;s:3:\"172\";}"]}},{"term_id":14,"name":"Japan","slug":"japan","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":14,"taxonomy":"destination","description":"Japan is a sovereign island nation in East Asia.

Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.\r\n\r\nKayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \"hunter's boat\" was for hunting and fishing. The kayak's stealth capabilities, allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline, and successfully catch their prey. By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport. In 1931, a man named Adolf Anderle became the first person to kayak down the Salzachofen Gorge, this is where the birthplace of modern-day white-water kayaking is believed to have begun.

The legal working week (British English), or workweek (American English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labour. In most of the Western world, it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}"]}}]}},{"type_title":"Trips","post_id":267,"post_title":"Ghandruk Trek","post_status":"publish","post_name":"ghandruk-trek","post_content":"The Annapurna Circuit is a trek within the Annapurna mountain range of central Nepal.The total length of the route varies between 160\u2013230 km (100-145 mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended.

According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;travail&quot; both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale).\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;"},"itinerary":{"itinerary_title":{"1":"Kathmandu to Pokhara (By flight or Bus)","2":"Drive to Nayapul and trek to Ulleri","3":"Trek to Ghorepani","4":"Early trek to Poon Hill for Sunrise, Back to Ghorepani and Trek to Tadapani","5":"Tadapani to Chomrong","6":"Chomrong to Dobhan (Dovan)","7":"Dovan to Deurali"},"itinerary_content":{"1":"Arrive at Tribhuwan International Airport, Kathmandu, you are welcomed by the team and then you will be transferred to your hotel.

Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 4,900 metres (16,000 ft).[citation needed] The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet  was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.[1] The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo. Most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai.

In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s.

People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.

The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"201\";i:1;s:3:\"201\";}"]}}]}},{"type_title":"Trips","post_id":269,"post_title":"Everest Base Camp Trek","post_status":"publish","post_name":"everest-base-camp-trek","post_content":"The Annapurna Circuit is a trek within the Annapurna mountain range of central Nepal.The total length of the route varies between 160\u2013230 km (100-145 mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended.

According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;travail&quot; both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale).\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;"},"itinerary":{"itinerary_title":{"1":"Kathmandu to Pokhara (By flight or Bus)","2":"Drive to Nayapul and trek to Ulleri","3":"Trek to Ghorepani","4":"Early trek to Poon Hill for Sunrise, Back to Ghorepani and Trek to Tadapani","5":"Tadapani to Chomrong","6":"Chomrong to Dobhan (Dovan)","7":"Dovan to Deurali"},"itinerary_content":{"1":"Arrive at Tribhuwan International Airport, Kathmandu, you are welcomed by the team and then you will be transferred to your hotel.

Lewis Carroll's fantasy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865 in England, was a landmark in the genre; regarded as the first \"English masterpiece written for children\", its publication opened the \"First Golden Age\" of children's literature.\n\nThe latter half of the 19th century saw the introduction of compulsory state schooling of children across Europe, which decisively removed children from the workplace into schools. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the concept of childhood as a time of fun of happiness. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys.

The American Kennel Club also offers a Companion dog title for judged dog obedience competitions.\n\nBreed groups argue that any dog in the working group type is inherently a \"working\" dog, while others argue that only a dog with an active occupation, either in a breed-related field (such as water trials for retrievers or herding trials for herding dogs) or in a breed-nonspecific field that requires training and discipline, such as being assistance dogs or participating in dog agility, can be considered a working dog.\n\nDogs that have been chosen for traits that make a convenient pet are generally smaller breeds, and the tradition of keeping pretty dogs for no purpose other than to be court decorations stems back thousands of years to Chinese nobility.

Volunteering is also renowned for skill development and is often intended to promote goodness or to improve human quality of life. Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served. It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.\n\nThe verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, \"one who offers himself for military service,\" from the Middle French voluntaire. In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage\u2014still predominantly military\u2014coinciding with the phrase community service.In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \"for free\" and are given regular pay.\n\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen. Barton founded the American Red Cross in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the Johnstown Flood in 1889.","parent":0,"count":21,"filter":"raw","meta":{"category-image-id":["a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"200\";i:1;s:3:\"200\";}","a:2:{i:0;s:3:\"200\";i:1;s:3:\"200\";}"]}},{"term_id":33,"name":"Weekend Trips","slug":"weekend-trips","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":33,"taxonomy":"trip_types","description":"The workweek and weekend are those complementary parts of the week devoted to labour and rest, respectively.

In most of the Western world, it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow the pattern, such as places of education.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday\u2013Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries historically had a Thursday\u2013Friday or Friday\u2013Saturday weekend; however, recently many such countries have shifted from Thursday\u2013Friday to Friday\u2013Saturday, or to Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of nineteenth century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning.

Climbing in the Himalayas","post_status":"publish","post_name":"mountain-climbing","post_content":"The term mountaineering describes the sport of mountain climbing. While some scholars identify mountaineering-related activities as climbing (rock and ice) and trekking up mountains,others are also adding backpacking, hiking, skiing, via ferrata and wilderness activities,and still others state that mountaineering activities also include indoor climbing, sport climbing and bouldering.However most of the scholars, the term mountaineering understand as a climbing (which now refers to adventure climbing or sports climbing) and trekking (hill walking in 'exotic' places). Hiking in the mountains can also be a simple form of mountaineering when it involves scrambling, or short stretches of the more basic grades of rock climbing, as well as crossing glaciers.\n\nWhile mountaineering began as attempts to reach the highest point of unclimbed big mountains it has branched into specializations that address different aspects of the mountain and consists of three areas: rock-craft, snow-craft, and skiing, depending on whether the route chosen is over rock, snow or ice. All require experience, athletic ability, and technical knowledge to maintain safety.\n\nMountaineering is often called Alpinism, especially in European languages, which implies climbing routes with minimal equipment in high and often snow and ice-covered mountains such as the Alps, where technical difficulties frequently exceed environmental and physical challenges. A mountaineer who pursues this more technical and minimalist style of mountain climbing is sometimes called an Alpinist, although use of the term may vary between countries and eras. The word \"alpinism\" was born in the 19th century to refer to climbing for the purpose of enjoying climbing itself as a sport or recreation, distinct from merely climbing while hunting or as a religious pilgrimage that had been done generally at that time.\n\nThe UIAA or Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme is the world governing body in mountaineering and climbing, addressing issues like access, medical, mountain protection, safety, youth and ice climbing.\n\nHistorically, many cultures have harbored superstitions about mountains, which they often regarded as sacred due to their perceived proximity with heaven, such as Mount Olympus for the Ancient Greeks.\n\nOn April 26, 1336 famous Italian poet Petrarch climbed to the summit of 1,912m Mount Ventoux overlooking the Bay of Marseilles, claiming to be inspired by Philip V of Macedon's ascent of Mount Haemo, making him the first known alpinist.\n\nOne of the first European mountains visited by many tourists was Sn\u011b\u017eka. This was mainly due to the relatively minor technical difficulties ascent and the fact that since the sixteenth century, many resort visitors flocked to the nearby Cieplice \u015al\u0105skie-Zdr\u00f3j and highly visible Sn\u011b\u017eka, visually dominant over all Krkono\u0161e was for them an important attraction. The first confirmed ascent took place in the year 1456.\n\nIn 1492 Antoine de Ville, lord of Domjulien and Beaupr\u00e9, was the first to ascend the Mont Aiguille, in France, with a little team, using ladders and ropes. It appears to be the first recorded climb of any technical difficulty, and has been said to mark the beginning of mountaineering.\n\nIn 1573 Francesco De Marchi and Francesco Di Domenico ascended Corno Grande, the highest peak in the Apennine Mountains. During the Enlightenment, as a product of the new spirit of curiosity for the natural world, many mountain summits were surmounted for the first time.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2017-10-24 10:32:30","post_date_gmt":"2017-10-24 04:47:30","guid":"https:\/\/thebootstrapthemes.com\/previews\/travel-tour-pro-2\/?p=135","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"wp_travel_engine_booking_status":"booked","_raratheme_view_count":"30","_dp_original":"132","_bttk_view_count":"247","_blog_sidebar_widget_view_count":"106","_edit_lock":"1617198096:1","_thumbnail_id":"495"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":2,"name":"Camping","slug":"camping","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":2,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":374,"post_title":"Exploring Untravelled Destinations","post_status":"publish","post_name":"exploring","post_content":"Exploration is the act of searching for the purpose of discovery of information or resources. Exploration occurs in all non-sessile animal species, including humans. In human history, its most dramatic rise was during the Age of Discovery when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons. Since then, major explorations after the Age of Discovery have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery.\n\nIn scientific research, exploration is one of three purposes of empirical research (the other two being description and explanation). The term is commonly used metaphorically. For example, an individual may speak of exploring the Internet, sexuality, etc.\n\nThe Phoenicians (1550 BCE\u2013300 BCE) traded throughout the Mediterranean Sea and Asia Minor though many of their routes are still unknown today. The presence of tin in some Phoenician artifacts suggests that they may have traveled to Britain. According to Virgil's Aeneid and other ancient sources, the legendary Queen Dido was a Phoenician from Tyre who sailed to North Africa and founded the city of Carthage.\n\nDuring the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty explored much of the Eastern Northern Hemisphere. Starting in 139 BC, the Han diplomat Zhang Qian traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da Yuezhi against the Xiongnu (the Yuezhi had been evicted from Gansu by the Xiongnu in 177 BC); however, Zhang's travels discovered entire countries which the Chinese were unaware of, including the remnants of the conquests of Alexander the Great (r. 336\u2013323 BC).When Zhang returned to China in 125 BC, he reported on his visits to Dayuan (Fergana), Kangju (Sogdiana), and Daxia (Bactria, formerly the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom which had just been subjugated by the Da Yuezhi). Zhang described Dayuan and Daxia as agricultural and urban countries like China, and although he did not venture there, described Shendu (the Indus River valley of Northwestern India) and Anxi (Arsacid territories) further west.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2017-10-24 10:29:51","post_date_gmt":"2017-10-24 04:44:51","guid":"https:\/\/thebootstrapthemes.com\/previews\/travel-tour-pro-2\/?p=132","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"wp_travel_engine_booking_status":"booked","_raratheme_view_count":"15","_dp_original":"96","_bttk_view_count":"73","_blog_sidebar_widget_view_count":"102","_edit_lock":"1617197699:1","_thumbnail_id":"494"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":2,"name":"Camping","slug":"camping","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":2,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":376,"post_title":"Skydiving from Mt.

It is both visually and cartographically a striking physiographic feature extending approximately 1,600 km (1,000 mi) from Flathead Lake, Montana to the Liard River, just south of the British Columbia-Yukon border near Watson Lake, Yukon. The trench bottom is 3-16 km (2\u201310 miles) wide and ranges from 600-900 metres (2,000\u20133,000 feet) above sea level. The general orientation of the Trench is an almost uniform 150\/330 degree geographic north vector and has become convenient for north\/south aviators.\n\nAlthough some of its topography has been carved into glacial valleys, it is primarily a byproduct of faulting. The Trench separates the Rocky Mountains on its east from the Columbia Mountains and the Cassiar Mountains on its west. It also skirts part of the McGregor Plateau area of the Nechako Plateau sub-area of the Interior Plateau of British Columbia. It is up to 25 km wide, if measured peak-to-peak, and varies in valley relief, but is clearly visible by air and satellite\/remote sensing and is easily discernible to those ascending any of the mountains or ridges lining it.\n\nThe Trench is drained by four major river basins: the Columbia, Fraser, Peace and Liard. Two reservoirs of the Columbia River Treaty fill much of its length today - Lake Koocanusa and Lake Kinbasket. A further British Columbia power initiative created Lake Williston. Rivers that follow the Trench, at least in part, are the Kootenay River, the Columbia River, the Canoe River, the Flathead River, the Fraser River, the Parsnip River, the Finlay River, the Fox River, and the Kechika River. The North Fork of the Flathead River, flowing into Flathead Lake with the other branches of the Flathead River, is part of the Columbia River system. The Kechika is part of the Liard River system, and the Fox, Parsnip and Finlay Rivers and part of the Peace River system. The Canoe River is a short tributary of the Columbia system, draining into Kinbasket Lake, a reservoir on the Columbia River. The Kootenai River, however, does not fully follow the Trench but exits Canada southwest via Lake Koocanusa reservoir to the Libby Dam. The Kootenay (Canadian spelling) River is a tributary of the Columbia, joining the Columbia at Castlegar, BC after a meander through the USA as the Kootenai River (US spelling).\n\nFor convenience the Rocky Mountain Trench may be divided into two sections, the Northern Rocky Mountain Trench and Southern Rocky Mountain Trench. The dividing point reflects the separation of north and easterly flows to the Arctic Ocean versus south and westerly flows to the Pacific Ocean. A break in the valley system at ~54\u00b0N near Prince George, British Columbia may be used for this purpose. The northern portion of the Trench is dominated by strike-slip faulting, while the southern part of the Trench was created by normal faults. Despite differences in timing and faulting styles of the northern and southern portions, they were aligned with each other because faulting for both was controlled by a pre-existing, west-facing, deep basement ramp with over 10 km of vertical offset.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2017-10-23 11:55:03","post_date_gmt":"2017-10-23 06:10:03","guid":"https:\/\/thebootstrapthemes.com\/previews\/travel-tour-pro-2\/?p=89","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"wp_travel_engine_booking_status":"booked","_dp_original":"86","_raratheme_view_count":"3","_bttk_view_count":"4","_blog_sidebar_widget_view_count":"86","_edit_lock":"1617198055:1","_thumbnail_id":"497"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":3,"name":"Sight Seeing","slug":"sight-seeing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":382,"post_title":"A Guide to Rocky Mountain vacations","post_status":"publish","post_name":"a-guide-to-rocky-mountain-vacations","post_content":"The Rocky Mountain Trench, also known as The Valley of a Thousand Peaks or simply the Trench, is a large valley in the northern part of the Rocky Mountains.

Comprising a territory spanning roughly 298 square kilometres (115 sq mi), the Maldives is one of the world\u2019s most geographically dispersed countries, as well as the smallest Asian country by both land area and population, with around 427,756 inhabitants.

In the past, the trip was often a big-game hunt, but today, safari often refers to trips to observe and photograph wildlife\u2014or hiking and sightseeing, as well. The Swahili word safari means journey, originally from the Arabic meaning a journey; the verb for \u201cto travel\u201d in Swahili is kusafiri. These words are used for any type of journey, e.g. by bus from Nairobi to Mombasa or by ferry from Dar es Salaam to Unguja. Safari entered the English language at the end of the 1850s thanks to Richard Francis Burton, the famous explorer. The Regimental March of the King\u2019s African Rifles was \u2018Funga Safari\u2019, literally \u2018tie up the March\u2019, or, in other words, pack up equipment ready to march. In 1836 William Cornwallis Harris led an expedition purely to observe and record wildlife and landscapes by the expedition\u2019s members. Harris established the safari style of journey, starting with a not too strenuous rising at first light, an energetic day walking, an afternoon rest then concluding with a formal dinner and telling stories in the evening over drinks and tobacco.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":22,"post_date":"2021-05-18 15:22:37","post_date_gmt":"2017-11-17 05:33:31","guid":"https:\/\/thebootstrapthemes.com\/previews\/travel-tour-pro-2\/?p=312","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"wp_travel_engine_booking_status":"booked","_menu_item_type":"taxonomy","_menu_item_menu_item_parent":"422","_menu_item_object_id":"11","_menu_item_object":"activities","_menu_item_classes":[""],"_menu_item_target":"","_menu_item_xfn":"","_menu_item_url":"","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-17"},"terms":{"category":[],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[{"term_id":37,"name":"Primary","slug":"primary","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":37,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":27,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}},{"type_title":"Navigation Menu Items","post_id":462,"post_title":"","post_status":"publish","post_name":"382","post_content":" ","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":6,"post_date":"2021-05-18 15:22:37","post_date_gmt":"2017-11-17 09:31:30","guid":"https:\/\/thebootstrapthemes.com\/previews\/travel-tour-pro-2\/?p=382","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"wp_travel_engine_booking_status":"booked","_menu_item_type":"post_type","_menu_item_menu_item_parent":"423","_menu_item_object_id":"249","_menu_item_object":"trip","_menu_item_classes":[""],"_menu_item_target":"","_menu_item_xfn":"","_menu_item_url":"","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-17"},"terms":{"category":[],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[{"term_id":37,"name":"Primary","slug":"primary","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":37,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":27,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}},{"type_title":"Navigation Menu Items","post_id":463,"post_title":"","post_status":"publish","post_name":"383","post_content":" ","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":9,"post_date":"2021-05-18 15:22:37","post_date_gmt":"2017-11-17 09:31:30","guid":"https:\/\/thebootstrapthemes.com\/previews\/travel-tour-pro-2\/?p=383","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"wp_travel_engine_booking_status":"booked","_menu_item_type":"post_type","_menu_item_menu_item_parent":"462","_menu_item_object_id":"258","_menu_item_object":"trip","_menu_item_classes":[""],"_menu_item_target":"","_menu_item_xfn":"","_menu_item_url":"","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-17"},"terms":{"category":[],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[{"term_id":37,"name":"Primary","slug":"primary","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":37,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":27,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"trip-packages-categories":[],"destination":[],"activities":[],"trip_types":[]}},{"type_title":"Navigation Menu Items","post_id":466,"post_title":"","post_status":"publish","post_name":"317","post_content":"Companion dog usually describes a dog that does not work, providing only companionship as a pet, rather than usefulness by doing specific tasks. Many of the toy dog breeds are used only for the pleasure of their company, not as workers. Any dog can be a companion dog, and many working types such as retrievers are enjoyed primarily for their friendly nature as a family pet, as are mixed breed dogs. The American Kennel Club also offers a Companion dog title for judged dog obedience competitions. Breed groups argue that any dog in the working group type is inherently a \u201cworking\u201d dog, while others argue that only a dog with an active occupation, either in a breed-related field (such as water trials for retrievers or herding trials for herding dogs) or in a breed-nonspecific field that requires training and discipline, such as being assistance dogs or participating in dog agility, can be considered a working dog.

In cases where money is not exchanged in return for accommodation, they are examples of a barter economy or gift economy. Students that are studying abroad and wish to participate in a homestay typically arrange them via the same local educational consultant who also organizes the academic aspect of their program. Independent students who assume all of their own travel arrangements can contact a local homestay placement agency to tailor their accommodation details, or alternatively may inquire via their respective school of study.

classes emphasized the role of the family and the sanctity of the child, \u2013 an attitude that has remained dominant in Western societies ever since. The genre of children\u2019s literature took off, with a proliferation of humorous, child-oriented books attuned to the child\u2019s imagination. Lewis Carroll\u2019s fantasy Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865 in England, was a landmark in the genre; regarded as the first \u201cEnglish masterpiece written for children\u201d, its publication opened the \u201cFirst Golden Age\u201d of children\u2019s literature. The latter half of the 19th century saw the introduction of compulsory state schooling of children across Europe, which decisively removed children from the workplace into schools. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the concept of childhood as a time of fun of happiness. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys.

It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well. Kayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to \u201chunter\u2019s boat\u201d was for hunting and fishing.
