This project contains the wordpress project with the react app.
The folder react-app contains the react application. To run this app locally, you will navigate to the folder and run the following
npm install
npm start

For testing
The build version is already added to the wordpress folder. 
Kindly the check the plugins folder and look for graph. Both css and the compiled react app is inside css and js folder respectfully.

Launch the wordpress app. Make sure you have enough posts to test the app. Active the plugin (Graph) and locate the widget Graph 
on the dashboard. Click on it and load the data to plot it.

Thanks.
